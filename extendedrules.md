- Treat everyone with respect. Don't use slurs or offending/discriminating content, be respectful of other people's opinions, and treat people the way you want to be treated!
- Please follow Discord's TOS. Rare exceptions are rare, but mostly still required to be followed.
Guidelines: https://discordapp.com/guidelines
- Keep your aggressiveness down when arguing with staff about your punishment.
- Anything against the law in the US or Canada will not be encouraged by us, and a user is not allowed to encourage it either. You wouldn't download your mother's opinions!
- Please do not spam messages a lot.
- Only advertise in the self promo channel, not in a user's DMs or otherwise.
- If you see something against the rules or something that makes you feel unsafe, let staff know. We want this server to be a welcoming space!
- No NSFW or obscene content. In other words, if you wouldn't send it to your loved ones, you shouldn't send it at all.
- Your nickname cannot contain sexist, racist, threatening, or otherwise NSFW content. If your username has explict or possibly offending content, a nickname will not 
- Common Sense, yo! If you think it wouldn't be a good idea, it probably isn't!
- Please do not harass my trusted+ users. If you feel uncomfortable by them, message me and I will investigate myself.
- Do not take away a user's ability to vent in the vent channel. This includes posting offtopic content, telling people to stop ranting or that nobody cares, invalidating their opinions through the rant, taking offense to a different opinion, etc. They need that right, they might need to get it off their chest!
