- Treat everyone with respect. Don't use slurs or offending/discriminating content, be respectful of other people's opinions, and treat people the way you want to be treated!
- Please follow Discord's TOS. Rare exceptions are rare, but mostly still required to be followed.
Guidelines: https://discordapp.com/guidelines
- Keep your aggressiveness down when arguing with staff about your punishment.
- Anything against the law in the US or Canada cannot and will not be encourged. You wouldn't download a car!
- Please do not spam messages a lot.
- Only advertise in the self promo channel, not in a user's DMs or otherwise.
- If you see something against the rules or something that makes you feel unsafe, let staff know. We want this server to be a welcoming space!
- No NSFW or obscene content. In other words, if you wouldn't send it to your loved ones, you shouldn't send it at all.
- Your username must be SFW and cannot contain a banned word. Use a nickname if you are required to keep your username for a temporary amount of time. I.E: a dare
- Common Sense, yo! If you think it wouldn't be a good idea, it probably isn't!
