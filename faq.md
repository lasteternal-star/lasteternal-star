# Minecraft
#### What mods do you use?
Read here: https://github.com/lasteternal-star/lasteternal-star/blob/AFLF/configs.md
#### What can you recommend me? I'm starting out on Hypixel/Mineplex/Other Server!
Everybody is different, and prefer different things! Try out a couple clients/launchers and see what works for you. I only recommend LC/BLC/LabyMod/etc if you want to start modding but DO NOT KNOW HOW YET. Start with it for a few weeks and get a feel for the game. Then read guides on modding and find replacements for the mods you enjoyed. Only install optifine if you really need it!

# Server
#### Shouldn't you ban innapropiate nicknames too?
Some people may be under cooldown or have been forced to do it on a dare. We want to be polite about these instances.
# General
#### N/A.
